# Tentative Title
 "Homelessness in the United States"

# Motivation 
Due to a lack of accessible mental health resources, rising cost of living with stagnant wages, and housing insecurity, homelessness is on the rise in the United States. As a group consisting of California and New York residents, homelessness as a public health issue is at the forefront. 

# Intended Final Products 
  - Comprehensive website detailing the issue, key findings, and displays like maps, graphs, and reports. 
  - Screencast explaining our website and how to use it
  - Dashboard specifically looking at CA and NY homelessness predictors and associations
  
# Anticipated Data Sources
 - HUD Exchange
 - NOAA weather data

# Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding challenges
 - writing collaboratively and correct collaboration on Github
 - using Shiny apps to make interactive graphs and maps
      - this could pose an issue since group members are not familiar with this program
 - we plan to analyze the differences in homelessness rates/numbers between major contributing states (CA and NY) and if this is related to weather and climate data
 - plan to display maps showing homelessness by state/city and weather 
 - comparing homelessness over time (reader friendly interactive graphs)
 - exploratory analysis could include CoC specific data provided in the dataset, specific predictors/associations have not been discussed
